# Minecraft-Console-Updater
This repository is for my Minecraft updating software. It’s available for all these old consoles: Xbox 360, PS3, PS Vita, Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. To use and install Minecraft: Caves &amp; Cliffs with this on your legacy console, you’ve to buy Minecraft: Bedrock Edition in the Store (e.g. for the Xbox 360 updater, you’ve to buy Minecraft for the Xbox one).
